fling a window around

Version 1:

Use "fling topleft" and "fling bottom", and similar combinations  to
get the active window shifted to one of 8 segments of the screen

Use fling 50n 30e to move to the top right, using 50% of the vertical
space, and 30 % of the horizontal space. You can use n, s, c for the first
gravity, and e, w, c for the second. "c" centers the window on-screen

xinerama is supported: use "-s<num>" to shift from the current xinerama
monitor.

Any _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL hints on windows will be obeyed as much as
possible.
